## Password/Sensitive information sharing

Passwords and other sensitive infos (server ips etc..) should only be shared through the Proton's vault and stored localy in this folder if necessary.

Information needed by Ansible will be stored on a seperate private github repos filtered by ssh-keys

This folder is in the .gitignore on purpose to prevent sending out secrets by mistake
